# Traversal-Binary-Search-Tree
### About This Repository
I independently completed freeCodeCampâ€™s [Scientific Computing with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/) certification, to invest in my scientific computing skills with Python. This repository contains my independent problem-solving work, as part of the tenth project in this curriculum. I devised a script for this ([Traversal-Binary-Search-Tree.py](https://github.com/franpanteli/Traversal-Binary-Search-Tree-Python-Project/blob/main/Traversal-Binary-Search-Tree.py)), which defined two Python classes, to set up a binary tree and perform inorder traversal on this. This introduced binary trees with values at each node of the tree and the branches to the right of nodes as having smaller values than them. Methods were defined as part of this, too add nodes into the tree, search for a node with a given key in the tree, to delete nodes from the tree and to find the minimum value of a node in the tree. These were combined into an inorder traversal method and further methods were defined to implement this recursively. This was implemented on a test instance of the tree class, with seven nodes. The project .py file includes in-depth problem solving approaches used to write this program and my project [problem solving notes](https://github.com/franpanteli/Traversal-Binary-Search-Tree-Python-Project/blob/main/Traversal%20Binary%20Search%20Tree%20Problem%20Solving%20Thought%20Process%20Notes.txt) contain more information regarding its theory. This enabled me to invest in my traversal binary search knowledge with Python and marked the successful completion of the tenth project in the certification.
