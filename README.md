# Traversal-Binary-Search-Tree
### About This Repository
I independently completed freeCodeCampâ€™s [Scientific Computing with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/) certification, to invest in my scientific computing skills with Python. This repository contains my independent problem-solving work, as part of the tenth project in this curriculum. I devised a script for this ([Traversal-Binary-Search-Tree.py](https://github.com/franpanteli/Traversal-Binary-Search-Tree-Python-Project/blob/main/Traversal-Binary-Search-Tree.py)). This defined two Python classes, the first to set up a binary tree and the second to perform inorder traversal on this. This introduced binary trees, with values at each node of the tree and the right sub-branches having smaller values. Methods were defined as part of this tree class, which added nodes into the tree, searched for a node with a given key, deleted nodes from the tree and found the minimum value of one of its nodes. These were combined into an inorder traversal method and further methods were defined to implement these recursively. A test on an instance of the tree class was created, with seven nodes. The project .py file includes in-depth problem solving approaches used to write this and my project [problem solving notes](https://github.com/franpanteli/Traversal-Binary-Search-Tree-Python-Project/blob/main/Traversal%20Binary%20Search%20Tree%20Problem%20Solving%20Thought%20Process%20Notes.txt) contain more information regarding its theory. This enabled me to invest in my traversal binary search knowledge with Python and marked the successful completion of the tenth project in the certification.
